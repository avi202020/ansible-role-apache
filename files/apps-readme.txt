# Virtual host specific application configuration directives
#
# In this directory are directories for each available virtual host defined
# for this server. In those directories, additional configuration files that
# contain directives specific to installed applications can be found.
#
# Config files can be symlinked into the appropriate virtual host directory
# from where the application is installed. Config files can also be symlinked
# into additional directories if the same configs apply to more than one
# virtual host.
#
# Files are processed in alphabetical/numerical order, so if certain config
# directives should come before others, be sure to place them in a file who's
# name appears earlier in the directory listing.
