#
# This directory holds Apache 2.x virtual host configuration files;
# these files are NOT processed as part of the Apache configuration.
#
# These files represent possible virtual host configurations. To enable
# a configuration, create a symlink from this file to one located in
# the ../sites-enabled directory.
#
# To enable a site:
#   sudo a2ensite 000-site.domain.tld
#
# To disable a site:
#   sudo a2dissite 000-site.domain.tld
#
#
# Files are processed in alphabetical/numerical order, so each virtual
# host configuration file should start with a three digit number. The
# first digit should be used to indicate different domains, the second
# digit should indicate different hosts within the domain, and the third
# digit should be used to indicate different configurations. The filename
# should also include the host and domain of the server and be suffixed
# with "-ssl" if the configuration is for an SSL virtual host.
