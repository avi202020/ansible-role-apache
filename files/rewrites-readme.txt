#
# Virtual host specific url rewrite rules
#
# In this directory are directories for each available virtual host defined
# for this server. In those directories, additional configuration files that
# contain url rewrite rules can be placed.
#
# Symlink rewrite rule files into additional directories if the same rules
# apply to more than one virtual host.
#
# Files are processed in alphabetical/numerical order, so if certain rewrite
# rules should come before others, be sure to place them in a file who's name
# appears earlier in the directory listing.
